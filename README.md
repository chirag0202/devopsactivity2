# devopsactivity2
This is the dockerfile for an activity that I did for my DevOps Assembly Lines Training under the mentorship of Mr. Vimal Daga Sir.

Activity Statement:
1. Create container image thatâ€™s has Jenkins installed using dockerfile 

2. When we launch this image, it should automatically starts Jenkins service in the container.

3. Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3 and job4 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins 

4. Job1 : Pull the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.

5. Job2 : By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the respective language interpreter install image container to deploy code ( eg. If code is of PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed ).

6. Job3 : Test your app if it is working or not.

7. Job4 : if app is not working , then send email to developer with error messages.

8. Create One extra job job5 for monitor : If container where app is running. fails due to any reson then this job should automatically start the container again.
